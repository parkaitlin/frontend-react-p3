mind8full is an application that hopes to provide a space for personal meditation. We want our visitors to take care of their mental health in the method they see fit. As you may know meditation takes many forms, at mind | full we do it in the form of snacks: gummy bears, cough drops, and some munchies.

Let us explain… the first two are simply sending good vibes depending on what you need in the moment. This usually includes a serene backdrop and a quote to ponder about. Gummy bears are for when you are looking for some inspiration, and cough drops are for those days you need a little mood booster.

(I know, I’m sorry there aren’t any real snacks)<br/><br/>

The third option, “something to munch on”, is an exercise where we send you a prompt that can be discussed internally or you have the option to write a journal entry. When you create an account you'll have access to your very own journal to keep track of your progress and  revisit your entries.<br/><br/>

Using one of these three methods, we encourage you to take a mental break each day. you are doing everything to live your best life and we would like to support you as best as we can. We hope mind8full serves purpose in your journey, so please visit often!

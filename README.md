#Mind|Full

mind | full is an application that hopes to provide a space for personal meditation. We want our visitors to take care of their mental health in the method they see fit. As you may know meditation takes many forms, at mind | full we do it in the form of snacks: gummy bears, cough drops, and some munchies.

Let us explain… the first two are simply sending good vibes depending on what you need in the moment. This usually includes music, a serene backdrop, and a quote to ponder about. Gummy bears are for when you are looking for some inspiration, and cough drops are for those days you need a little mood booster.

(I know, I’m sorry there aren’t any real snacks)<br/><br/>

The third option, “something to munch on”, is an exercise where we send you a prompt with the option to discuss internally or to write a journal entry. When you create an account you will have a calendar to track your progress and your very own journal to hold your entries.<br/><br/>

Using one of these three methods, we encourage you to take a mental break each day. you are doing everything to live your best life and we would like to support you as best as we can. We hope mind | full serves purpose in your journey, so please visit often!

###Tech & Frameworks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

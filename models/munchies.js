        title: "Exercise Your Mind",
        quote: "Possessing a creative mind...is something like having a border collie for a pet: it needs to work, or else it will cause you and outrageous amount of trouble. Give your mind a job to so, or else it will find a job to do, and you might not like the job it invents",
        author: "Elizabeth Gilbert",
        prompt: "It only takes a few minutes to realize that your mind doesn't have an on/off switch. As Elizabeth Gilbert says, it's more like a large and energetic dog. Our minds give us some of the best experiences, but they can be quite destructive. To give your mind something to do, put it to work noticing beauty and joy in the world. Right now ask it to put aside today's depressing news headlines, the hurtful comment that a colleague made at work, and even the list of items you need to buy at the grocery store. Ask it to think of ten beautiful things it has encountered in the last 24 hours, and ask it to go on noticing beauty throughout the day to come."

        title: 'Responding to Failure',
        quote: 'The way in which man approaches his failure determines he will become',
        author: 'Karl Jaspers',
        prompt: 'We all know failure can be painful and discouraging. Every person alive has defining failures in his or her past. Not all of these failures will be surmounted: Some will permanently define the personality of a person. We do not need to see these failures as obstacles to be overcome. Perhaps they are just part of our psychic makeup like mental wallpaper. We can identify many types of failure, some that prove to be transformative, and others that block our growth for years. Mindfulness practice can help to develop clarity about failure. Give yourself permission to reflect for a few minutes on one defining failure in your life. Is this failure simply something to be discarded, or is it something to be overcome through more strenuous effort?Make a resolution to meet your failure not through regret or self-blame, but through concrete action to be taken in the present. Brainstorm a few steps you can take to leave your past in the past and make a new start'

        title: 'Hear the Silence Around You',
        quote: 'Sages send the spirit to the storehouses of awareness and return to the beginning of myriad things. They look at the formless, listen to the soundless. In the midst of profound darkness they alone see light; in the midst of silent vastness, they alone have illumination',
        author: 'Huai-nan Tzu',
        prompt: 'We can be pretty uncomfortable with unoccupied time, with empty spaces, with lingering silences. We like to have every single second filled with information, with words, with entertainments, and yes, with meaning. We have forgotten to pay attention to the silences, to the spaces between the words, to the unintelligible. And yet, what would music be without any rests? In meditation, we train ourselves to sit silently, to listen, to the apparent nothingness of background noise. Eventually, if conditions are just right, we can hear and feel the blood rushing in our ears, the high eee sound of thought, th elub-dub of the heart, the inhalation and exhalation of breath. What appeared to be silence actually becomes the subtle music of our surroundings, the beating heart of this moment, and the dance of the cosmos. If we can resist running away from the initial awkwardness of silence and stillness, a new way of being emerges, one that is more patient, more attentive, and more joyous. This is the light that emerges from the darkness, the speech that comes from silence. For 5-10 minutes sit as quietly as you can and try to notice the rythms of you own body and the little sounds that often go unnoticed. See if you can listen without commenting'

        title: 'Embrace Change',
        quote: 'Accepting change correctly brings us into harmony with reality...which is what happiness is really about. Being in touch with, in harmony with, reality is being in harmony with God - the ultimate reality. the aim of all spiritual practice is to enable us to experience this fullness and dynamism...concretely, whether in washing the dishes or chanting the Psalms',
        author: 'The Monks of New Skete',
        prompt: "One of the major troubles in the practice of meditation is to want to hold onto pleasant interior experiences, to want bliss all the time. Inevitably, the high moments fade, even though we crave them. Observing the world, we notice that everything is in flux, every state passes, things change, we must learn to let cherished things, people, and experiences come and go like the wind. We must open our hearts so widely that we do not hinder change from happening, so that we do not try to freeze our relationships or circumstances in place. Quickly make a list of 3 changes that have happened over the course of your life. These changes may be hopeful, upsetting, load-lifting changes. Hold these changes before your mind's eye and cultivate and inner attitude of loving and embracing change. Picture your powerful, loving heart taking the edges off life's transitions so that they become smoother and natural. Cherish the most loving course of action, and see yourself gracefully accepting change into your life"

        title: 'Find Calm in the Storm',
        quote: 'Our emotions and thoughts are like the weather. They are sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant, always changing. We can do little to control them directly, and are wise not to try... And after the occasional, inevitable storm had passed, we only need to quietly watch as the clouds dissipate on their own without any help from us',
        author: 'Steve Hagen',
        prompt: 'Most of us would not try to wrestle an alligator, or get into a rowboat and steer it toward a hurricane. And yet we readily plunge into the storms of negative thoughts when they arise, thinking in vain that we can manage them and make them conform to our wills. You may think the analogy is not apt because, after all, thoughts occur inside our own heads. Our thoughts, you might think are the very contents of ourselves. And yet they come and go as they like, and we are not very adept at controlling them. The trick of meditation, if there is a trick, is to regard our thoughts as something external like the weather of like a passing crowd. No matter what happens, avoid identifying with the thoughts. Regards them as out there, not in here.'
